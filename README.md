This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and variant data types.  The `IsEmpty` function doesn't reliably detect empty variants passed as function arguments, leading to unexpected behavior.  The `bug.vbs` file showcases the problem. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a more robust solution.
